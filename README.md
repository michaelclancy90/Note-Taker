# **Note Taker**

## **Introduction** 
<br />
For this project, my goal is to create an app that would allow the user to add and delete notes.

<br />

## **User Story**
<br />
AS A small business owner 
 <br />
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
 <br />
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

<br />

## **Acceptance Criteria**
<br />
GIVEN a note-taking application <br />
WHEN I open the Note Taker <br />
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page <br />
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page <br />
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column <br />
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text <br />
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page <br />
WHEN I click on the Save icon <br />
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes <br />
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column <br />
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column<br />
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page <br />
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column <br />
